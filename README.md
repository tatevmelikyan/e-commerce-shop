This is a team project for a Frontend Bootcamp program. Our team built an E-commerce website using React, Typescript, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Firebase for backend. Our goal was to create a website that provides a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for customers, with a focus on high-quality design and functionality.

## Features
* **User authentication:** Customers can create an account, log in, and view their order history.
* **Product catalog:** Customers can browse a range of products and filter by category, price, and other attributes.
* **Product details:** Customers can view detailed information about products, including images and descriptions.
* **Shopping cart:** Customers can add products to their cart and view the total price of their order.
* **Favorites:** Customers can mark products as favorites, view them in a separate section of the website, and remove products from their favorites.
* **Checkout:** Customers can enter their shipping and payment information and place their order.
* **Admin panel:** Store owners can log in and manage products, orders, and customer information.
* **Responsive design:** The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
* **React:** A popular front-end library for building user interfaces.
* **Typescript:** A typed superset of Javascript that helps catch errors early and improve code readability.
* **Redux Toolkit:** A library for efficient and easy-to-use state management in React applications.
* **Firebase:** A cloud-based platform for building web and mobile applications, including authentication, database, and hosting services.
