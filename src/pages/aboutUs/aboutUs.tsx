      <h1>Our Story</h1>
     <p>
     It all started in 2021, when the home-grown entrepreneur and former architect began to create 
      furniture which he designed himself. The success of his first creations lead to the opening of an 
      exclusive furniture store in the heart of the capital. As the only furniture store in Yerevan, he 
      quickly became one of the top local suppliers for both private clients and interior designers.

     It is not only the customers who have difficulty finding what they want; the staff can also find it 
      difficult. The store is a maze, and it is not always clear where things are. The storeâ€™s layout was
      designed in such a way that it would be difficult for customers to find items and employees to keep
      track of them. This meant that sometimes customers would go from one side of the store to the other,
      searching in vain for what they needed while the staff went around, pushing trolleys and displaying
      an apologetic look on their faces.

      This story tells us that all these difficulties were solved by using technology, like an app which
      shows where all the items in the store are placed.
